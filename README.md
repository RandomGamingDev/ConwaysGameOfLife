# ConwaysGameOfLife
A super fast GPU and more specifically WebGL based version of Conway's game of life.

- Use h for help
- Use p to pause & play
- Use m to switch between place & erase mode
- Use t to set the tick speed per frame (60fps)
- Use c to declare cursor size
- Use r to declare a new canvas with a new size
- Use s to save the world as a png
- Use l for loading an image to paste (p was already used lmao)
- Use esc to escape out of lay mode
